This repository allows You (if it is supported by your IDE) to simply include Qt header file by Qt type name.
Add `_qt_headers` to C++ include search path and then type:

  #include <qt/Q
  
And then Your IDE will suggest a suitable types for You.

All You need to configure Your IDE is to add `$(YourHeadersRoot)/_std_headers` to Your IDE `Include Path`.
